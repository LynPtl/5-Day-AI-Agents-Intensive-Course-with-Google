# Day 3 (Context Engineering: Sessions & Memory)

> Today's whitepaper focuses on context engineering, which is the process of designing, building, and maintaining the context that is provided to an agent. This includes the agent's session history, memory, and any other information that the agent needs to perform its tasks.

> In today's codelabs, you will learn how to manage agent sessions and how to provide your agent with a memory to allow for more sophisticated and stateful conversations.
