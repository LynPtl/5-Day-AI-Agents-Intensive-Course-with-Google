# Day 2 (Agent Tools & Interoperability with Model Context Protocol (MCP))

> Today's whitepaper focuses on external tools functions that allow an agent to perform actions or retrieve real-time data beyond its training set and introduces best practices for designing effective tools. You'll learn about MCP, highlighting its architectural components, communication layer, risks and enterprise readiness gaps.

> In today's codelabs, you will create custom tools for your agents by turning your own Python functions into actions your agent can perform. You'll also use MCP and implement long-running operations where an agent can pause tool calls while waiting for human approval, before resuming.
